## ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm Dewi ð“€™

My name is Dewi and I'm currently finishing my master's in Applied Maths specialising in Machine Learning and Statistics. My focus is mostly deep generative modelling with some classical statistics and elliptic curve cryptography on the side.

Currently seeking an internship as the remaining component of my master's in which I can apply my skills in machine learning to real-world problems.

Nice books:
1) Judea Pearl's `The Book of Why` - causal modelling book. Super nicely-written though some of his takes on the limits of extracting correlations from data seem exaggerated and sometimes just outdated.
2) Janelle Shane's `You Look Like a Thing and I Love You` - I'd suggest this to friends or family who want a rough idea of how machine learning models work without any rigorous detail.
3) Cade Metz's `Genius Makers` - Ignore the cringy title. Great book about the history of the big names in deep learning. If you've watched many interviews by people like Hinton, LeCun, etc. then you'll already have heard of a lot of the stories written about in this book but it's nice to have them all, plus more, in a single book.
4) CÃ©dric Villani's `Birth of a Theorem` - Memoir-style writings by mathematician CÃ©dric Villani about his time working on his work which earned him a field medal.

Nice blogs/writings:
1) [James Betker's blog](https://nonint.com/) - became interested in his writing after reading about his comparison of denoising diffusion models to gradient descent
2) [Richard Sutton's writings](http://incompleteideas.net/) - found his writings through his `The Bitter Lesson` being talked about a lot
3) [Chris Olah's blog](https://colah.github.io/) - nicely-rounded collection of topics
4) [Lilian Wengâ€™s blog](https://lilianweng.github.io/) - posts are detailed and well-written (somewhat irregular times between posts)
