## ð“€™ Hello there, I'm Dewi ð“€™

Finishing my master's in Applied Maths specialising in Machine Learning and Statistics. My focus is mostly deep generative modelling with some classical statistics and elliptic curve cryptography on the side.

Currently seeking an internship as the remaining component of my master's in which I can apply my skills in deep learning to real-world problems.

Nice books:
1) Judea Pearl's `The Book of Why` - Great causal modelling book. Super nicely-written though some of his takes on the limits of extracting correlations from data seem exaggerated/outdated.
2) Cade Metz's `Genius Makers` - Ignore the cringy title. Great book about the history of big names in deep learning. If you've watched many interviews of people like Hinton, LeCun, etc. then you'll already have heard of a lot of the stories written in this book but it's nice to have them all, plus more, in a single book.
3) CÃ©dric Villani's `Birth of a Theorem` - Memoir-style writings by mathematician CÃ©dric Villani about his time working on his work which earned him a fields medal. Interesting guy.
4) Janelle Shane's `You Look Like a Thing and I Love You` - I'd suggest this to friends or family who want a rough idea of how machine learning models work without having to see any maths.

Favourite blogs/writings:
1) [James Betker](https://nonint.com/) - I became interested in his writing after reading his comparison of diffusion models and vanilla gradient descent. James has interesting perspectives.
2) [Richard Sutton](http://incompleteideas.net/) - I found his writings through his `The Bitter Lesson` being talked about a lot.
3) [Lilian Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io/)
<!-- 4) [Chris Olah](https://colah.github.io/) - nicely-rounded collection of topics -->
