## â—¡Ìˆ Hi, I'm Dewi

Finishing my master's in Applied Maths specialising in Machine Learning and Statistics. My focus is mostly deep generative modelling with some elliptic curve cryptography on the side. Soon to start an interesting internship which will complete my master's and hopefully kick-start a career of deep learning research in industry.
