## 𓀙 Hello there, I'm Dewi 𓀙

Finishing my master's in Applied Maths specialising in Machine Learning and Statistics. My focus is mostly deep generative modelling with some classical statistics and elliptic curve cryptography on the side.

Currently seeking an internship as the remaining component of my master's in which I can apply my skills in deep learning to real-world problems.
