## Hi, I'm Dewi 👋˙ᵕ˙

I build deep generative models and language models in PyTorch, with a strong applied maths background.

- Research and teaching experience in machine learning and cryptography
- Master's thesis: hybrid-objective deep generative models for image generation and anomaly detection (through PyTorch)
- Seeking Machine Learning Engineer / Research Engineer roles
